    <p>
        My name is Brandi Whitmore, but I also go by Rose (my middle name). I am currently a student at the University of Missouri and am in the College of Engineering. I am planning on having a career in the Information Technology field. I am not sure exactly what I want to do but I am hoping to figure that out before I graduate in 2024. I have worked at Ulta Beauty as a Prestige Beauty advisor for about a year and a half. When I am not working or doing homework I spend most of my time with my cats; Boo and Finnley. I also enjoy spending my time painting, singing, dancing, playing video games, and hanging out with my friends. I also enjoy reading comic books or manga at night or when a small break is needed from schoolwork. At the moment I am reading Lore Olympis, which is about Greek mythology and the love story between hades and persephone.
