    <h2>Project 1</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The first project is a project 
        that I was a part of with two others in the summer of
         2022. This project was completed as a capstone project
          and was completed in Dublin, Ireland. The goal of this 
          project was to capture objects with significant meaning
        to the Irish people using photogrammetry to allow 
        people who may not be located in Ireland to be able to
        still experience and learn about these different objects.
         Since there are so many different things that are important 
         to the Irish we decided while we were there we wanted to 
         focus on Irish mythology and folktales.</p>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>I believe the work that every member in the group contributed 
        led to us having an incredible project we were all happy and 
        proud of. I ended up learning a lot about the different aspects 
        of photogrammetry, the software blender, and a little bit about 
        Unity and developing a 3D environment. We were successfully able 
        to capture a bit of Irish culture through their folktales. This 
        resulted in us being able to share what we had learned with 
        others who were able to view our project. Viewers were able to 
        see the different models we had created from different objects 
        that were important to different Irish folklore. </p>

    <h2>Project 2</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This second project is one that I did for the Columbia Police 
        Department. The Columbia Police Department was wanting a short 
        informative video for all possible audiences making a commitment 
        to the community to exemplify the qualities of diversity, equity, 
        and inclusion. They also wanted to explain to outsiders what they 
        were doing in order to exemplify those qualities, including auditing 
        policy that may have bias and undergoing regular and frequent bias 
        training. I ended up using Kinetic Typography and some other 
        different animation techniques to create this video. This project 
        was created in Adobe Photoshop and Adobe After Effects. </p>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>I am proud of how this project ended up turning out. I believe I was 
        able to perfectly capture what the Columbia Police Department was wanting. 
        I was able to time the animations throughout this ad to match with a script 
        they wanted me to create. I used the animated text to draw a viewer's attention 
        as a way to emphasize the parts of the script that were important. I was also 
        able to animate the text to appear in a satisfying and attention keeping way. 
        I believe that this ended up looking professional and it helped the client 
        portray what they were hoping for. </p>

    <h2>Project 3</h2>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This project was one that I created on the behalf of Vidwest Studios. 
        This is a short advertisement in order to bring awareness to their 
        company and the different things that their company did. Vidwest 
        Studios was wanting to highlight their studio space that they offer 
        for people to reserve as well as the equipment Vidwest Studio owned 
        and rented out. I was given a script and some different video concepts 
        that Vidwest Studios wanted me to include in the advertisement itself. 
        I also was able to use their logo and different projects they had used 
        in the past to create the advertisement in a style personalized to their 
        company.</p>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>This project ended up being exactly what Vidwest Studios was looking for. 
        I was able to do some research and learn new techniques in After Effects 
        to make sure that I was able to do everything that I could to deliver a 
        project that would be exactly what they were wanting. I was able to do 
        everything that Vidwest studios was hoping for and I was able to take the 
        ideas they had written out and create what they had been picturing. I took 
        a lot of time planning how I wanted this project to turn out and I think in 
        the end it helped me to create a product everyone was happy with.</p>

    <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
        <p>So far in my journey into the technology field, I have learned a lot and 
            I have many things to reflect on already. I have been a part of several 
            different projects at this point in time and each one has taught me something 
            new. I have always been a visual and kinesthetic learner and accomplishing 
            these projects allowed me to truly ingrain the multiple things I had learned. 
            At this point I have mainly participated in digital media projects and I 
            honestly have really enjoyed these types of projects. </p>
